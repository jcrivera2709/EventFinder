This program allows users to connect by having an admin login and display events (club meetings, parties, among other things). While a regular user is able to view the events, its details, as well as add/edit/delete contacts to keep track of their friends information that you meet at these events. The program provides easy access to other screens especially the login screen to allow the user to change access from admin to regular user for different features.
